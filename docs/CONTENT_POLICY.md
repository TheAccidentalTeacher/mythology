## 🤖 AUTOMATED MODERATION

### **How It Works:**

1. **Student submits content** (character, story, description)
2. **AI scans content** using OpenAI Moderation API
3. **Analysis for:**
   - Hate speech
   - Violence (excessive)
   - Sexual content
   - Self-harm
   - Profanity

4. **Result:**
   - **✅ Pass:** Content saved, published
   - **❌ Fail:** Content rejected, student sees error

**Student sees:** *"Your content violates community guidelines. Please revise and try again."*

**Teacher sees:** Flagged content in "Flagged Content" queue with reason

---

### **False Positives:**

AI moderation sometimes over-flags mythology-appropriate content.

**Example:**
- Student writes: "The god of death reigned over the underworld"
- AI flags: "violence/death-related"
- **Solution:** Teacher manually reviews and approves

**For Teachers:**
- Review flagged content in **"Flagged Content"** tab
- Approve if mythology-appropriate
- Reject if genuinely inappropriate
- Provide feedback to student

---
