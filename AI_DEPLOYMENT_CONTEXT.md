## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT IS THIS?

### The Vision

**The Mythology Codex** is a web-based creative writing platform where **middle school students (grades 6-8, ages 11-14)** build their own original mythology universes. Think of it as "Minecraft meets Percy Jackson meets Google Docs."

Students create:
- **Gods and goddesses** with powers, domains, and personalities
- **Mythical creatures** from dragons to sea monsters
- **Epic stories** with heroes, battles, and quests
- **Interactive world maps** with sacred locations
- **Relationship networks** showing how characters connect
- **AI-generated artwork** for their creations

### Why This Exists

This isn't just a creative writing tool. It's an **educational experience** that:

1. **Teaches narrative structure** - Students learn plot, character development, world-building
2. **Integrates academic standards** - Alaska ELA standards, Five Themes of Geography, Alaska Native cultural awareness
3. **Builds digital literacy** - Students use modern web tools, collaborate online, present work
4. **Encourages research** - Comparing mythologies, understanding cultural context
5. **Makes learning fun** - Gamification (points, badges, levels), AI battles, trading cards

### The Spirit & Feel

**This app has PERSONALITY.** It's:

- ✨ **Whimsical** - Emoji everywhere, playful UI, "Epic Worldbuilder" badges, confetti on achievements
- 🎮 **Gamified** - XP points, level-up systems, streaks, leaderboards (but friendly competition, not cutthroat)
- 🤖 **AI-Enhanced** - But AI assists, never replaces student creativity
- 🎨 **Visually Rich** - Dark mode by default, gradient backgrounds, animated battles, holographic trading cards
- 📚 **Educational but not boring** - Standards-aligned but feels like a game
- 🌊 **Alaska-Focused** - Built for Copper River region (65% Alaska Native students), but works anywhere

## 🎓 EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY & VALUE

### The "Extended Mind" Approach to AI

**Core Principle:** AI should not write the mythology, but AI should help students write the mythology.

**How We Implement This:**

1. **AI Suggests, Student Chooses**
   - Name suggestions: AI offers 5 options, student picks or ignores
   - Story ideas: AI asks questions, student answers
   - Grammar: AI marks issues, student fixes

2. **Scaffolding, Not Completion**
   - Wizard guides setup, doesn't auto-fill
   - Prompts ask probing questions
   - Help buttons show examples, not templates

3. **Transparent AI Use**
   - Teacher dashboard shows AI usage
   - Students know when they're using AI
   - Parents receive letters explaining AI's role

4. **Token-Gating Creative AI**
   - Image generation requires math quiz
   - Teaches "AI costs resources"
   - Limits over-reliance

### Academic Standards Alignment

**Alaska ELA Standards (Common Core):**
- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.6-8.3** - Narrative writing
- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.6-8.4** - Clear, coherent writing
- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.6-8.5** - Planning, revising, editing
- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.6-8.5** - Multimedia presentations

**Alaska Social Studies - Five Themes of Geography:**
- **Location** - Absolute and relative positioning
- **Place** - Physical and human characteristics
- **Human-Environment Interaction** - How people adapt/modify
- **Movement** - People, goods, ideas
- **Regions** - Areas with common features

**Alaska Cultural Standards:**
- **A1** - Culturally-knowledgeable students are grounded in cultural heritage
- **E5** - Students create innovative solutions using local knowledge
- **E7** - Students use technology to strengthen connections

**Alaska Math Standards:**

## 🛡️ CONTENT SAFETY & MODERATION

### Why This Matters

**Context:** 11-14 year olds creating content, AI generating images, student collaboration.

**Risks:**
- Inappropriate language in stories
- Violent/sexual content
- Bullying via crossover battles
- AI generating unsafe images
- Plagiarism (copying from Percy Jackson)

### Safety Systems

#### 1. Triple-Layer Image Safety

**Layer 1: Blocklist**
- Hard-blocked explicit terms
- Checked before AI generation
- File: `safetyFilter.ts`

**Layer 2: Pattern Detection**
- AI scans prompt for concerning content
- Looks for: violence, sexual, hateful, self-harm
- Rejects before image generation

**Layer 3: System Prompt Wrapper**
- Enforces age-appropriate output
- No text/words in images
- Family-friendly, educational tone

#### 2. Teacher Content Moderation

**Features:**
- Visibility controls (public, teacher-only, hidden)
- Flag inappropriate content
- Review queue for teacher
- Bulk actions (approve all, hide all)
- Moderation log

#### 3. Student Account Safety

**Features:**
- Classroom-scoped (students only see classmates)
- No direct messaging
- No profile pictures (custom avatars only)
- Parent access to portfolios

### Deployment Considerations

- **OpenAI Moderation API** integration planned (not yet implemented)
- **Profanity filter** for text content (TODO)
- **Image moderation** dashboard for teachers (implemented)
- **Reporting system** for students (TODO)

- RLS policies too restrictive
- Auth token not being sent
- Service role key not used for admin operations

**Solutions:**
1. Check RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
2. Verify auth middleware is running
3. Use `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/server` for API routes
4. For admin operations, use service role key

#### Issue: Images Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Image URLs return 403 Forbidden
- CORS errors in browser console

**Causes:**
- CORS not configured in Supabase Storage
- Image bucket not public
- Invalid storage URLs

**Solutions:**
1. Supabase → Storage → Buckets → Make public
2. Add CORS rules:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "origin": "https://your-app.vercel.app",
       "methods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
       "headers": ["*"]
     }
   ]
   ```
3. Update next.config.ts with remote patterns

#### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` is undefined
- API calls fail with "Missing API key"

**Causes:**
- Env vars not set in Vercel
- Wrong environment (Production vs Preview vs Development)
- Client vs Server confusion (NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)

**Solutions:**
1. Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add to ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Redeploy after adding env vars
4. Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side vars
5. NEVER expose secret keys client-side

#### Issue: Database Migrations Not Applied

**Symptoms:**
- Tables don't exist in production
- Queries fail with "relation does not exist"

**Causes:**
- Migrations not run on production database
- Wrong Supabase project (dev vs prod)

**Solutions:**
1. Supabase → SQL Editor → Run migrations manually
2. Or use Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --project-ref your-prod-ref
   ```
3. Verify tables exist:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db dump --project-ref your-prod-ref
   ```

## 📊 MONITORING & MAINTENANCE

### What to Monitor Post-Deployment

1. **API Costs**
   - OpenAI usage: Check dashboard monthly
   - Gemini usage: Check Google Cloud billing
   - Target: <$50/month for 100 active students

2. **Error Rates**
   - Vercel analytics: Track 500 errors
   - Supabase logs: Track failed queries
   - Target: <1% error rate

3. **Performance**
   - Vercel speed insights: Track load times
   - Target: <3s initial page load

4. **Storage**
   - Supabase storage quota: Check monthly
   - Images can grow quickly (100MB per student)
   - Target: <10GB total

5. **User Activity**
   - Active students per day
   - Average time on site
   - Mythologies created per week

### Maintenance Tasks

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Check error logs

## 🎯 QUICK START FOR AI ASSISTANTS

### When You're Asked to Help with Deployment

1. **First, read this entire document** (you're doing it now!)

2. **Ask clarifying questions:**
   - "Are you deploying for the first time or debugging an existing deployment?"
   - "What error message are you seeing?"
   - "Can you share the build logs?"

3. **Check the basics:**
   - Are environment variables set?
   - Is the build succeeding locally?
   - Are migrations applied to production DB?

4. **Reference these docs:**
   - This file: Big picture, deployment strategy
   - `README.md`: Feature list, quick start
   - `PROJECT_STATUS.md`: Implementation status
   - `CHANGELOG.md`: Recent changes
   - `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Specific error fixes

5. **Maintain context:**
   - Keep deployment log as you work
   - Summarize progress every 30 minutes
   - When close to token limit, suggest creating a checkpoint

### When Context is Lost Mid-Deployment

If the conversation resets:

1. **User should say:**
   *"We're deploying The Mythology Codex to Vercel. Read AI_DEPLOYMENT_CONTEXT.md first. We were debugging [SPECIFIC ERROR]. Here's our deployment log so far: [PASTE LOG]."*

2. **You should:**
   - Read this document
   - Review deployment log
   - Identify where we left off
   - Continue from that point
